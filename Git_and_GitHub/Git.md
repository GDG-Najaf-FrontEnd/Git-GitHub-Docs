[Git](https://git-scm.com/video/what-is-version-control)
is a [**<span class="underline">version control
system</span>**](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control)
that allows you to keep track of changes made to a project over time. It
records these changes and gives you the ability to go back to a previous
version of your project. In short, it enables you to review how your
project grows.

As a programmer, your daily routine will be  💻 \<--\> 🍔🌭🥤\<--\>😴, so
through the coding daily phase you create, save, edit and save things
again.

So imagine your life without **Git**. it would be hard to edit saved
code again, it would be harder to go back to a specific phase of the
development. It would be harder than harder to collaborate with others
to build one single project\! I know\! It’s gonna be a mess. We can’t
live without it.

Here the magic comes,
**Git** provides you with many useful things that made our life as a
programmer much easier:

  -  Revert the code files to their previous state

  -  Recall and revert the entire project back to its previous state

  -  Compare code changes over specific durations of time

  -  Find who last modified a piece of code that might be causing an
     issue or a problem

  -  Who introduced a particular issue, when, and why.

### Why Git?

  -  Git is a fast and modern implementation of version control.

  -  Git provides a history of content changes.

  -  Git facilitates collaborative changes to files.

  -  Git is easy to use for any type of knowledge worker.

Here’s a stolen image 😬 that clarifies some of the valuable commands
using git.

### Installation
[<span class="underline">Press me for the installation</span>](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Once Git is connected to a network, it allows you to push your project
to GitHub or other alternatives such as Bitbucket, Beanstalk, or GitLab
for sharing and collaborating with other developers. We will go with
GitHub in our course.
